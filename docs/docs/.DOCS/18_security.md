## Supported Versions

The following versions of Vector Studio are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Vector Studio seriously. If you believe you have found a 
security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@vectorstudio.dev** (or create 
a private security advisory on GitHub).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please 
follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

After you submit a vulnerability report:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.

2. **Investigation**: We will investigate the issue and determine its impact and 
   severity. We may reach out to you for additional information.

3. **Resolution**: We will develop and test a fix for the vulnerability. The 
   timeline depends on the complexity and severity of the issue.

4. **Disclosure**: Once a fix is available, we will:
   - Release a patched version
   - Publish a security advisory
   - Credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Best Practices

When using Vector Studio:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of Vector Studio to ensure you 
   have the latest security patches.

2. **ONNX Models**: Only load ONNX models from trusted sources. Malicious models 
   could potentially execute arbitrary code.

3. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all input data before passing it 
   to Vector Studio, especially when processing user-generated content.

4. **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls when exposing Vector Studio 
   functionality through APIs or network services.

5. **Memory Safety**: While we use modern C++ practices and SIMD-safe operations, 
   always monitor memory usage in production environments.

6. **Database Files**: Protect database files with appropriate filesystem permissions. 
   Vector Studio databases are not encrypted by default.

### Scope

The following are considered in-scope for security reports:

- Memory corruption vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.)
- Remote code execution
- Denial of service vulnerabilities
- Information disclosure
- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- Input validation issues leading to security impact

The following are generally out-of-scope:

- Vulnerabilities in dependencies (report to the dependency maintainers)
- Issues requiring physical access to the host machine
- Social engineering attacks
- Issues in unsupported versions

### Recognition

We value the security research community and are committed to working with 
researchers who help us keep Vector Studio secure. Contributors who report valid 
security issues will be:

- Credited in the security advisory (if desired)
- Listed in our security hall of fame
- Thanked publicly in release notes

Thank you for helping keep Vector Studio and its users safe!
