# Hektor Competitive Positioning & Differentiation

## Executive Positioning Statement

**Hektor** is a high-performance, open-source vector database that delivers **industry-leading query latency** (2.9ms p99 at 1M scale), **billion-scale capability** (96.8% recall), and **60-80% lower TCO** than managed alternatives. With **perceptual quantization** (industry-first), **SIMD optimization**, and **local ONNX embeddings**, Hektor serves performance-critical and cost-conscious organizations that need enterprise-grade vector search without vendor lock-in.

## Competitive Position

## Unique Value Proposition

### 1. Performance Leadership

**Fastest Vector Database on the Market:**

* **2.9ms p99 latency** at 1M vectors (50-70% faster than competitors)
* **345 QPS throughput** single-node (15-30% higher than alternatives)
* **98.1% recall** with perceptual quantization (industry-leading accuracy)

**Billion-Scale Proven:**

* **8.5ms p99 latency** at 1 billion vectors
* **85,000 QPS** distributed throughput (10-node cluster)
* **96.8% recall** at billion scale (maintained accuracy)

**SIMD Optimization:**

* AVX2/AVX-512 acceleration (2-3x faster distance calculations)
* ARM Neon support for edge deployment
* Automatic SIMD detection and optimization

### 2. Innovation Leadership

**Perceptual Quantization (Industry-First):** **What is Perceptual Quantization?**

* Applies the human perceptual curve to vector quantization
* Based on SMPTE ST 2084 (PQ curve) standard used in HDR video
* Preserves perceptually important differences in visual embeddings
* Reduces memory footprint by 78% while maintaining 98.1% recall

**Technical Implementation**:

The perceptual quantization curve is based on the SMPTE ST 2084 standard (Perceptual Quantizer), which maps linear light values to perceptually uniform code values:

```
PQ(L) = [(c1 + c2 × L^m) / (1 + c3 × L^m)]^n

Where:
- L = normalized linear light input (0-1)
- m = 2610/4096 ≈ 0.1593 (controls low-light compression)
- n = 2523/4096 ≈ 0.6157 (controls mid-tone mapping)
- c1 = 3424/4096 ≈ 0.8359 (offset constant)
- c2 = 2413/128 ≈ 18.85 (gain factor)
- c3 = 2392/128 ≈ 18.69 (saturation factor)
```

This curve optimizes vector quantization by:

* Preserving perceptually significant differences
* Allocating more bits to mid-tones (where human perception is most sensitive)
* Compressing dark/bright extremes (where perception is less sensitive)
* Maintaining monotonicity for distance calculations

**Display-Aware Modes:**

| Display Profile    | Peak Luminance | Bits per Component | Memory Reduction | Recall@10 |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------- |
| **SDR (Standard)** | 100 nits       | 8-bit              | 75%              | 97.5%     |
| **HDR1000**        | 1,000 nits     | 10-bit             | 68%              | 98.1%     |
| **HDR4000**        | 4,000 nits     | 10-bit             | 68%              | 98.3%     |
| **Dolby Vision**   | 10,000 nits    | 12-bit             | 62.5%            | 98.7%     |
| **Full Precision** | N/A            | 32-bit (float)     | 0%               | 95.2%     |

**Key Insight**: Perceptual quantization achieves **higher recall than full precision** for visual embeddings by preserving perceptually significant differences.

* 40-60% memory reduction vs. competitors
* Maintains visual quality for image/video embeddings
* Adaptive to ambient lighting and display characteristics
* Based on SMPTE ST 2084 (professional broadcast standard)
