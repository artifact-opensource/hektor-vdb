# Operational Model

## Day-to-Day Operations

### Monitoring

* Prometheus metrics every 15s
* Grafana dashboards
* PagerDuty/Opsgenie alerts
* Key metrics: Latency (p99), QPS, memory, errors

### Health Checks

* /health endpoint every 30s
* Node availability checks
* Index corruption detection
* Automated recovery procedures

## Backup & Recovery

### Backup Schedule

* Full backup: Weekly (Sunday 2 AM)
* Incremental: Daily (2 AM)
* Snapshots: Hourly (if supported)
* Retention: 30 days

### Recovery Procedures

1. Identify failure scope
2. Switch to standby replica (if available)
3. Restore from latest backup
4. Validate data integrity
5. Resume normal operations

### RTO/RPO Targets

* RTO (Recovery Time): <1 hour
* RPO (Recovery Point): <15 minutes

## SLA Definitions

### Availability Tiers

**Standard (99.9%):**

* Max downtime: 43.8 minutes/month
* Support: Business hours
* Response: 24 hours

**Premium (99.95%):**

* Max downtime: 21.9 minutes/month
* Support: 24/7
* Response: 4 hours

**Enterprise (99.99%):**

* Max downtime: 4.38 minutes/month
* Support: 24/7 dedicated
* Response: 1 hour

### Performance SLAs

**Latency:**

* p50: <2ms
* p95: <5ms
* p99: <10ms

**Throughput:**

* Min QPS: 200 (single node)
* Scaling: Linear up to 10 nodes

**Uptime:**

* Measured monthly
* Excludes scheduled maintenance
* Credits for violations

## Maintenance Windows

### Scheduled Maintenance

* Frequency: Monthly
* Window: Sunday 2-6 AM UTC
* Notification: 7 days advance
* Duration: <4 hours

### Emergency Maintenance

* As needed for critical issues
* Notification: 4 hours if possible
* Immediate for security vulnerabilities

## Support Processes

### Ticket Priority

**P0 - Critical:**

* Production down
* Data loss/corruption
* Response: 15 minutes (Enterprise), 1 hour (Premium)

**P1 - High:**

* Severe performance degradation
* Partial outage
* Response: 4 hours (Enterprise/Premium), 24 hours (Standard)

**P2 - Medium:**

* Minor performance issues
* Feature requests
* Response: 1 business day

**P3 - Low:**

* Questions, documentation
* Response: 3 business days

### Escalation Path

1. L1: Support engineer (initial triage)
2. L2: Senior engineer (investigation)
3. L3: Development team (code fixes)
4. Emergency: On-call architect

## Operational Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**System Health:**

* Uptime: >99.9%
* Error rate: <0.1%
* p99 latency: <10ms

**Support:**

* Ticket response time (by priority)
* Resolution time
* Customer satisfaction score

**Capacity:**

* CPU utilization: <70% average
* Memory utilization: <80% average
* Disk utilization: <75%

### Capacity Planning

**Quarterly Review:**

* Growth projections
* Resource forecasting
* Budget planning

**Triggers for Scaling:**

* CPU >70% for 7 days
* Memory >80% for 3 days
* p99 latency >15ms for 24 hours

## Runbooks

### Common Procedures

**1. Node Addition**

```bash
# Add new node to cluster
./scripts/add_node.sh <node-ip>
# Rebalance data
./scripts/rebalance.sh
```

**2. Index Rebuild**

```bash
# Rebuild HNSW index
hektor-cli rebuild-index --collection <name>
```

**3. Backup Restoration**

```bash
# Restore from S3 backup
./scripts/restore.sh s3://backups/2026-01-22
```

**4. Performance Debugging**

```bash
# Profile query performance
hektor-cli profile --duration 60s
# Check SIMD usage
hektor-cli info | grep SIMD
```
