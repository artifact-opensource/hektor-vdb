# Deployment Architecture

## Cloud Deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### Single-Node Architecture

* Compute: c7i.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 32 GB)
* Storage: 200 GB NVMe SSD
* Network: 25 Gbps
* Use: Development, small production (<1000 QPS)

### Multi-Node Distributed

* 5-10 nodes cluster
* Load balancer + service mesh
* Shared storage or distributed index
* Use: Production, high availability

## On-Premises Deployment

### Hardware Setup

* Dedicated servers with AVX-512
* RAID 10 for storage
* 10/25 Gbps networking
* Full data sovereignty

## Hybrid Deployment

### Cloud + On-Prem

* Sensitive data on-prem
* Overflow to cloud for bursts
* Unified management plane

## Edge Deployment

### ARM-Optimized

* Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson
* Local inference, offline capable
* Sync to central cluster

## High Availability

### Multi-AZ Deployment

* Nodes across availability zones
* Automatic failover
* RPO: <1 minute, RTO: <5 minutes

### Disaster Recovery

* Cross-region replication
* Backup to object storage
* Runbook for recovery procedures
